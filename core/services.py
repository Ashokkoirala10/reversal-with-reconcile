"""
Core reconciliation logic.

Turns an "ibft-transaction_*.xlsx" export into a "need_to_reversal_*.xlsx"
workbook containing:

  - failed      : FAILED transactions, excluding "Insufficient funds"
  - coop        : manual-reversal transactions for every aggregator other
                  than IME REMIT / CITY REMIT, grouped by Member Name
  - imeremit    : manual-reversal transactions for the IME REMIT aggregator
  - cityremit   : manual-reversal transactions for the CITY REMIT aggregator
  - timeout     : TIMEOUT transactions, unchanged

This logic was reverse-engineered from a real ibft-transaction file and its
matching need_to_reversal output and validated row-for-row (104/104 reversal
rows, 29/29 failed rows, 1/1 timeout row) before being written here.

    For most networks, a reversal's DR entry carries the *original* CR
    entry's own trailing ISO id somewhere in its REMARKS, so
    is_already_reversed() (matching on that ISO id) catches a double
    reversal. NCHL settlement statements are different: the CR and DR legs
    for the very same underlying payment don't share the Network Reference
    Id *or* the ISO id at all — e.g.:

        CR  SCT/00000000KOQI/24883884901595327/11001000/DURLAV MAN SHRESTHA/S51287331
        DR  CIPS/SCT-00000000KOQI/DURLAV MAN SHRESTHA/15373/691590444/IPS/S51287339

    The two legs only reliably share two things: the beneficiary name
    (the token immediately before the CR's own trailing ISO id — "DURLAV
    MAN SHRESTHA" above) and the masked settlement account id embedded in
    both REMARKS ("00000000KOQI" above — present standalone in the CR leg,
    and embedded inside the compound token "SCT-00000000KOQI" in the DR
    leg, hence a substring scan rather than a token-equality lookup).

    Matching on name alone is too loose — the same beneficiary can
    legitimately receive several unrelated payments, so a name-only match
    risks red-flagging (and thus silently not reversing) an unrelated,
    still-outstanding transaction. So this requires *both* anchors — name
    **and** the settlement account id — to agree on the same DR entry
    before treating it as already debited/settled.

    One more wrinkle: that matched DR entry is itself a statement line
    with its own trailing ISO id. If *that* ISO id also shows up as a CR
    entry elsewhere in the statement, NCHL has effectively reversed its
    own reversal — the money that left as this DR came right back in, so
    the original credit is back to sitting unreversed in the parking
    account. In that case this DR is not a terminal "already debited"
    state after all, and the row must still go through the normal manual
    reversal (i.e. this function must NOT report it as already-debited).

    """Khalti-specific "already handled" check — a sibling of
    is_already_debited_nchl() above, for the same reason: Khalti's own
    settlement DR leg doesn't carry the original CR's trailing ISO id (so
    is_already_reversed() misses it), e.g.:

        CR  SCT/00000000P09X/9972886358965443/11012000/SUJAN KHANAL/S66930010
        DR  SCT/KHALTI_SETTL/00000000P09X/100220/00000000P0A2/S66930950

    Unlike NCHL, Khalti's DR leg does NOT carry the beneficiary name
    anywhere in its REMARKS — only the shared masked settlement account id
    ("00000000P09X" above, standalone in the CR leg and embedded right
    after the literal "KHALTI_SETTL/" marker in the DR leg). So this
    matches on the settlement account id alone, gated by that
    KHALTI_SETTL marker being present (instead of also requiring a name
    match, which would never fire for Khalti) to still avoid a
    false-positive match against an unrelated DR entry that happens to
    reuse the same masked account digits.

    Same reversal-of-reversal guard as is_already_debited_nchl(): if the
    matched DR's own trailing ISO id shows up as a CR entry elsewhere in
    the statement, Khalti reversed its own settlement debit back out, so
    this isn't a terminal "already debited" state and the row must still
    go through the normal manual reversal.

    `expected_amount`, when given, additionally requires the matched DR
    entry's own AMOUNT to be within a paisa of it — see
    is_already_debited_nchl()'s own note on this parameter above.
