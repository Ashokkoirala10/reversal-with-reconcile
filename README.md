# IBFT &rarr; Reversal Generator (Django)

A small Django web app that takes the daily `ibft-transaction_*.xlsx` export and
produces a `need_to_reversal_*.xlsx` file, exactly like the manual process it
replaces:

- **failed** sheet: `FAILED` transactions, excluding "Insufficient funds"
- **coop** sheet: manual-reversal transactions for every aggregator other
  than IME REMIT / CITY REMIT, grouped by Member Name (alphabetical), each group's
  "S NO" restarting at 1
- **imeremit** sheet: manual-reversal transactions where Aggregator = `IME REMIT`
- **cityremit** sheet: manual-reversal transactions where Aggregator = `CITY REMIT`
- **timeout** sheet: any `TIMEOUT` transactions, unchanged

For every kept reversal row, three fields are (re)built:
- **Debit Account Number** — the fixed clearing account `0002335524115`,
  **except** when the original transaction's **Debtor Bank is Prabhu Bank**,
  in which case the dedicated account `99901170130555` is used instead
  (Prabhu Bank reversals are rare but need their own account).
- **Credit Account Number** — the *original* row's Debit Account Number (the
  money goes back to wherever it was originally pulled from)
- **narration** (in the duplicated "Member Transaction Id" column) —
  `REV` + the member transaction id with its leading zeros and leading
  prefix/letters stripped + `-` + Session Id
  (e.g. `REQ_1783249894525` &rarr; `REV1783249894525-100168`,
  `IME-00113275637-572` &rarr; `REV00113275637-572-100168`)

All id-like columns (Member Transaction Id, Network Reference Id, Session Id,
Debit/Credit Account Number) are written as **text**, not numbers, in the
output workbook. Long numeric ids (17+ digits) silently lose trailing
precision if Excel is allowed to store them as a number — this was traced
back as the likely cause of a past mismatch between a source file's Member
Transaction Id and what showed up in the generated reversal file (the
narration still matched because it was already being built as a string, not
a number). Forcing text format everywhere makes that class of bug
impossible going forward. If it ever happens again, please save the exact
source value + what showed up in the generated file, so the real cause can
be confirmed and fixed for good.

## Bank statement upload (multiple files)

The "Check against bank statement" page accepts one **Global IME Bank**
statement and up to **3 Prabhu Bank** statement files (e.g. separate daily
exports), combined into one file automatically before checking. The file
inputs support the browser's native multi-select (ctrl/shift-click all the
files in one dialog), **and** also let you open "Choose files" more than
once — each pick is *added* to your selection (shown as removable chips)
instead of replacing it, up to the 3-file Prabhu limit. This avoids the
common trap where a plain multi-file `<input>` silently drops everything
except the most recent pick if files are selected one at a time across
separate dialog opens.

## Double-reversal prevention

Before writing a new reversal file, the app looks at the **most recently
generated file that has already been marked "passed"** (see below — not
just any generated file) and collects every Network Reference Id that
already appears in its `coop` / `imeremit` / `cityremit` sheets. Any row in
the new upload whose Network Reference Id is already in that set is skipped
(and counted as `duplicate_skipped` in the audit log / result page / day
reconciliation popup) instead of being reversed a second time.

## Login

There is no self-registration — two hardcoded accounts are seeded by a data
migration (`core/migrations/0003_seed_users.py`):

| Username        | Password    | Role                                             |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `ashok.koirala` | `ashok@123` | Regular operator — can upload/generate            |
| `admin`         | `admin@123` | Admin — also sees the central Audit Log & Dashboard |

Change these passwords (via `/admin/` or the Django shell) before using this
anywhere beyond your own machine — they're intentionally simple/hardcoded
per the current requirements.

## Passed workflow (review before it's shared)

A newly generated file only shows up in **your own "My activity" list** —
not the central shared list, and not the analytics dashboard — until you
(or an admin) review it and click **"Mark as passed"** (on the result page,
or right from the activity table). Once passed:

- it moves into the **"Shared passed reports"** central list, visible to
  everyone
- it's included in the analytics dashboard
- it becomes the baseline the *next* upload's double-reversal check compares
  against (see below)

Anyone can unmark their own passed report; admins can mark/unmark anyone's.

## UI

- **Generate page** (`/`): a 3-column layout — upload form on the left,
  the central **"Shared passed reports"** list in the middle (bigger, since
  it's the shared source of truth), and your own **"My activity"** on the
  right. Both activity tables are paginated 10 rows at a time, and file
  columns are icon-only download buttons (hover for the filename).
- **Audit Log** (`/audit-log/`, admin only): every file from every user,
  passed or not, with Prabhu-reroute / unrecognized-bank / duplicate-skip
  counts per row.
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard/`, admin only): all-time totals (including
  amount + charge for success, failed, manual reversal, and system
  reversal) plus a day-by-day breakdown. **Click any day** to open a full
  reconciliation popup: manual reversal vs. system reversal vs. failed vs.
  success, each with count/amount/charge, the day's failure-reason
  breakdown, and the usual double-reversal / Prabhu-reroute / unrecognized-
  bank checks. Charge follows the same business rule as the generated file
  itself — NCHL-routed transactions carry their charge inside the amount,
  so their charge is treated as 0 everywhere charge is summed. Also
  includes two **separate** reports: a **Member-wise report** (success /
  failed / reversal count + amount rolled up per Member Name, across every
  aggregator) and an **Aggregator-wise report** (same, rolled up per
  Aggregator instead) — kept as two independent tables/tabs rather than one
  mixed (Member, Aggregator) table, since they answer different questions.
- "Manual reversal" vs. "system reversal": a `REVERSAL` row is a **manual**
  reversal if its Source Message says so (these are the ones written into
  the generated file); any other `REVERSAL` row is a **system** reversal
  (the switch already reversed it automatically) — not written to the
  file, but still counted for reconciliation. **Exception:** a system
  reversal that is either **On-Us** (Global-to-Global or Prabhu-to-Prabhu)
  or **NCHL-routed** is written out to its own sheet in the generated file
  (`Onus Checked-System Reversal`) instead of only being counted, so it
  can still be reviewed.

## On-Us verification (Prabhu + Global)

"On-Us" means the Debtor Bank and Creditor Bank are the *same* one of our
own two banks — **Global-to-Global or Prabhu-to-Prabhu** (previously this
only covered Global-to-Global). On-Us rows get an extra "is this actually
already successful?" check, matching how NCHL rows are verified:

- On the **failed** sheet, an On-Us row whose Network Reference Id shows up
  as a **duplicate DR** in the bank statement (both legs of the transfer
  actually completed) is green-flagged and moved to "Already Success
  (OnUs)" instead of being treated as needing a reversal.
- On the **manual reversal sheets** (coop / imeremit / cityremit / prabhu),
  the same duplicate-DR check now also runs — catching an On-Us row that
  ended up there **by mistake** even though it was already successful —
  and red-flags it as already-reversed so nobody reverses it a second
  time. This mirrors the existing NCHL ref-id check on the same sheets.

## File naming

- Every uploaded source file is renamed/stored as `ibft_txn_data_<date>.xlsx`
  (date parsed from the original filename if it has one, otherwise today's
  date) — whatever it was originally called.
- Every generated file is `need_to_reversal_<date>.xlsx`. Downloads always
  use this clean name (via a dedicated download view), even though the
  file actually stored on disk may have a suffix Django added to avoid a
  naming collision.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py migrate        # also seeds the two hardcoded logins
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/, log in with either account above, upload
a file, and (as `admin`) check http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/ and
http://127.0.0.1:8000/audit-log/.

## Notes / things worth knowing

- The app reads the source workbook's **"Transactions"** sheet (or the first
  sheet if that name isn't found) and auto-detects the header row, so a stray
  "Period: ..." banner row above the header (as in the sample file) is
  handled automatically.
- If the uploaded file is missing an expected column, the app shows a clear
  error on the upload page and records the failure in the audit log — it
  won't silently produce a bad file.
- `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` / `FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` are raised to
  50 MB in `settings.py` since these exports can be large (the sample file
  was ~4.5 MB / ~29,000 rows). Raise further if needed.
- This ships with `DEBUG = True` and a placeholder `SECRET_KEY` — fine for
  running locally / on a trusted internal network, but change both (and set
  `DEBUG = False`, configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` properly, rotate the two
  hardcoded passwords, and put uploaded/media files somewhere
  access-controlled) before exposing this beyond your own machine, since
  transaction files are sensitive.
- The "Prabhu Bank" check matches the **Debtor Bank** column case-
  insensitively containing "PRABHU", so "Prabhu Bank", "Prabhu Bank
  Limited", etc. all match.
- The double-reversal check only looks at the single most recent prior
  successful file, matching the "one step behind" comparison that was
  asked for. If you skip a day (or need to check further back), the
  `extract_reversal_network_reference_ids()` helper in `core/services.py`
  can be pointed at any older generated file too.
